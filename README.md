# Description

> Created an employee directory with React. This  application's UI is separated into components, and managed by component state that respond to user input

# Installation

>No installation deployed from github-pages:

# Usage

 **As a User:**

* As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

* Given a table of random users, when the user loads the    page, a table of employees should render. 

The user is able to:

  * Sort the table by clicking on the table of employee's header. Profile Picture, Name, Phone, Email, Date of Birth are the categories

  * Use a coded filter method allowing the user to search for first name, last name, and month or year of birth.  
  
# Setup

#### Config Setup


   * React application is built with a home directory link using react-router-dom and api calls for the random employees. The link allows the user to select a link in the navigation bar without total reload of page. Axios is used to get the external information which is then filtered by sort and search and displayed for the user.
